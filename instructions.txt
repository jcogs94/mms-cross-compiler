For compiling with a MAKEFILE:
1. Run "install.sh"
2. Run "buildImage.sh"
3. Copy "crossCompile.sh" to your project directory that includes the MAKEFILE
	(the "crossCompile.sh" script should be in the same place that you would
	  normally run the "make" command in)
4. Run "crossCompile.sh" script

For compiling a single file:
1. Run "install.sh"
2. Run "cd" command into the "single-file" directory
3. Run "buildImage.sh"
4. Run "crossCompileFile.sh" script and pass the name of the file you want compiled
	first and then the name of the output file
	(ex. "./crossCompileFile.sh test.c outputExecutable")

NOTES:
- The script for cross-compiling a single file can also be copied elsewhere, but will
  still need to be passed the input and output file paths
- Compiling with MAKEFILE has not yet been tested and will most likely need more
  libraries added to the Dockerfile dependancies install
